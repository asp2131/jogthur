# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FitTracker is a modern mobile fitness tracking application that provides clean, professional exercise tracking with 3D character animations and reliable distance measurement. The app focuses on encouraging healthy fitness habits through engaging but subtle visual feedback. It targets casual to serious fitness enthusiasts who walk, run, or bike, providing a lightweight, performant solution that works offline without requiring user accounts.

## Requirements

3. WHEN the user selects an activity type (walk/run/bike) THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate tracking parameters for that activity
4. WHEN tracking is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time distance, pace/speed, and elapsed time with smooth updates
5. WHEN the user pauses a workout THEN the system SHALL stop GPS tracking while preserving current workout data
6. WHEN the user resumes a workout THEN the system SHALL continue GPS tracking from the previous state
7. WHEN the user stops a workout THEN the system SHALL save the complete workout data locally using Hive database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my workout progress in real-time with a clean, modern interface, so that I stay motivated during exercise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workout is active THEN the system SHALL display a split-screen layout with live map on top and 3D character on bottom
2. WHEN GPS location updates THEN the system SHALL draw the route on Google Maps with smooth polyline animation
3. WHEN workout data changes THEN the system SHALL update statistics with smooth number transitions using Flutter's animation system
4. WHEN the user's speed changes THEN the 3D character's animation speed SHALL match the user's real pace
5. WHEN the user reaches distance milestones THEN the 3D character SHALL perform subtle celebration animations
6. WHEN the user taps the 3D character THEN the system SHALL trigger encouraging visual feedback
7. WHEN activity type changes THEN the 3D character SHALL smoothly transition colors and appearance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my workout history and statistics with a clean interface, so that I can track my fitness progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses workout history THEN the system SHALL display a Material Design list of completed workouts
2. WHEN workout cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL show distance, time, pace, date, and activity type with proper typography
3. WHEN the user taps a workout card THEN the system SHALL navigate to detailed workout information with hero animations
4. WHEN displaying workout lists THEN the system SHALL use ListView.builder for efficient rendering of large datasets
5. WHEN the user deletes a workout THEN the system SHALL remove it with confirmation dialog and smooth removal animation
6. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL show total distance, workout count, and progress with clean visual indicators
7. WHEN loading workout history THEN the system SHALL retrieve data from Hive database efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to perform smoothly with minimal battery drain and modern design, so that I can track long workouts without device performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance during all interactions and animations
2. WHEN GPS tracking is active THEN the system SHALL consume less than 10% battery per hour through optimized location sampling
3. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL launch in under 2 seconds with proper splash screen
4. WHEN processing location data THEN the system SHALL filter GPS updates based on accuracy and distance thresholds
5. WHEN running background tracking THEN the system SHALL continue workout recording using WorkManager (Android) and background app refresh (iOS)
6. WHEN storing workout data THEN the system SHALL use Hive database for high-performance local storage operations
7. WHEN rendering animations THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's optimized animation system for smooth performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline without requiring accounts and follow modern design principles, so that I can track workouts immediately with a professional interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL allow immediate workout tracking without account creation
2. WHEN storing workout data THEN the system SHALL save all information locally using Hive database
3. WHEN the device has no internet connection THEN the system SHALL continue to function fully for tracking and history
4. WHEN accessing app features THEN the system SHALL not require any server communication for core functionality
5. WHEN managing user preferences THEN the system SHALL store settings locally with proper encryption
6. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL follow Material Design 3 guidelines with proper elevation and spacing
7. WHEN handling theme changes THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes with smooth transitions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive controls with smooth, professional animations, so that the app feels responsive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide subtle scale and ripple animations using Material Design patterns
2. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate visual feedback with proper timing and easing curves
3. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use a consistent color scheme with proper contrast ratios for accessibility
4. WHEN transitioning between screens THEN the system SHALL use smooth page transitions with hero animations where appropriate
5. WHEN achievements occur THEN the system SHALL show success animations with gentle, professional visual feedback
6. WHEN loading or processing THEN the system SHALL display Material Design progress indicators with proper timing
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show error states with helpful messaging and clear recovery options using snackbars

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on different mobile platforms, I want the app to work consistently on both iOS and Android with platform-appropriate design, so that I get a native experience on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on iOS THEN the system SHALL request "When In Use" and "Always" location permissions with clear explanations
2. WHEN running on Android THEN the system SHALL request FINE_LOCATION and BACKGROUND_LOCATION permissions following Android guidelines
3. WHEN background tracking is needed THEN the system SHALL implement WorkManager on Android and background app refresh on iOS
4. WHEN using platform-specific features THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback using Flutter's feedback system
5. WHEN accessing device capabilities THEN the system SHALL handle permission requests gracefully with proper error handling
6. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL continue GPS tracking using platform-appropriate background processing
